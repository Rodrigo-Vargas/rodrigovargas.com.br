The Ctrl + K spotlight mirror got me here. It come from a plugin named kbar(https://github.com/timc1/kbar), the project seems to be a bit abandoned, but it looks great still. This website also have a great website, very minimalist on the home, just what's needed for the user know what he needs.

I liked the overall presentation of Abhinay's website, everything that you need to know is already on the first page in a very clean way. The schedule a meeting button really caught my attention, showing some sort of call to action to engage with him.

On top of the minimalist layout, I like the idea of boxes used here. They make things more organized, consolidating things that are similar in a same place, very similar with house decluttering, where group things in a closed box feels more organized.

Ahmad website is very vibrant and well designed, but what really got my attention was that this guy has a huge list of achievements and his website list it every well. Also very interesting to notice he has no blog, this whole time is consumed with his masterclass and on opensource, altough his website fill the goal of stablish his online presence. I loved this strategy to grow his brand. Also, I notice he have free courses and paid courses, a good approach to onboard people on his more expensive courses, definitely a good plan to follow

Another very minimalistic vcard that remind me one of my previous versions of my personal blog. This style never fails, given it's very clean, and you know very quick how to find Arup in his main social medias.
